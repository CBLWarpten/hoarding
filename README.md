# hoarding
Setting up a hoarding server with plex, quickbox, encryption and much more

This a script created from hoarding.me
it creates the needed files and permission, however you still have to do a lot yourself. 
You have to follow the first page about ssh keys: https://hoarding.me/ssh-keys/
When that is done, continue here: 

apt-get install git -y
git clone https://github.com/CBLWarpten/hoarding
cd hoarding
chmod -x hoarding.sh
